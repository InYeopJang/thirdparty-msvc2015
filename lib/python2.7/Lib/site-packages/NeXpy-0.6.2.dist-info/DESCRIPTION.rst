NeXpy provides a high-level python interface to `NeXus data 
<http://www.nexusformat.org/>`_ contained within a simple GUI. It is designed to 
provide an intuitive interactive toolbox allowing users both to access existing 
NeXus files and to create new NeXus-conforming data structures without expert 
knowledge of the file format.

The latest development version is always available from `NeXpy's GitHub
site <https://github.com/nexpy/nexpy>`_.
